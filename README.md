# library_map
A text-based application that 
1. prompts the user to select one of three options: whether to enter a subject name or partname (e.g. “English”), a classmark, or a location;
2. prompts (according to the previous response) the user to enter the subject name/part-name, classmark or location (with location
options displayed); and
3. outputs each matching classmark together with its location and subject name(s).

Also comprises a second application (for the same task) that uses a TKinter-based graphical
user interface (GUI) for both input and output, rather than the text-based console.
